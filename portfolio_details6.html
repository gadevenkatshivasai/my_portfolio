            <h2><strong> CORROSION DIAGRAM</strong></h2>
            <p>
              <h3> Objective / Problem Statement</h3>
              The primary objective of this project was to develop a sophisticated web application that could efficiently analyze and report on corrosion patterns affecting various structures. The challenge was to create a system capable of processing and categorizing corrosion types from uploaded images, providing users with precise and actionable insights, and generating comprehensive reports.
            </p>
            <h3> What I Did</h3>
            <p> As the lead developer, I spearheaded the entire development process. This involved designing and implementing a robust backend system using PHP to handle data processing and report generation. I integrated this backend with a JavaScript-powered frontend, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly interface. Additionally, I implemented advanced image processing techniques to automatically detect and categorize different types of corrosion. I also developed an automated report generation feature using the TCPDF library, which produced detailed PDF reports that included visual representations and in-depth analysis of corrosion data. Finally, I designed an efficient database schema to ensure data integrity and quick access to corrosion data</p>
            <h3> Tools Used</h3>
            <li> <strong> Backend Development: </strong> PHP</li>
            <li><strong> Frontend Development</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap 5</li>
            <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> OpenCV</li>
            <li><strong> Report Generation</strong> TCPDF library for generating PDF reports</li>
            <li><strong> Database Management</strong> Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)</li>
            <li><strong> Collaboration Tools:</strong> Git for version control, and JIRA for project management
            </li>
          </p>
          <h3> Outcome</h3>
          <p> The project resulted in the successful creation of a high-quality, reliable system for corrosion detection and analysis. The system provided users with an easy-to-use interface for uploading images, viewing analysis results, and generating detailed reports. The automated report generation feature significantly improved the efficiency of the reporting process, delivering comprehensive insights with minimal user intervention.</p>

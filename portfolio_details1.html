              <h3> Objective/Problem Statement</h3>
            <p> 
              The primary objective of this study was to investigate the role of discussion forums in e-learning environments, specifically how they contribute to the development and maintenance of learning communities. The study also aimed to explore how these forums enhance students' learning skills and knowledge, as well as their interaction with instructors. The problem addressed is the need for effective tools that foster community, engagement, and peer-to-peer learning in online education.

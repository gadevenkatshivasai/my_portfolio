            <h2>BLOCKCHAIN FOR HEALTHCARE APPLICATIONS</h2>
            <p>
              The incorporation of blockchain technology has garnered significant interest in the
healthcare business in recent years. This creative solution shows a lot of promise for
resolving the numerous issues that come with electronic health record systems. Using a
corpus of 144 academic publications, this study analyzes the state of blockchain
applications in the healthcare industry. Together, these articles examine the potential
benefits and limitations of blockchain technology for improving the efficiency of
healthcare operations. The main objective is to highlight the various uses of blockchain
technology and explain its promise as well as its challenges. The research begins with a
thorough examination of the foundations of blockchain technology and its unique
characteristics. The following sections provide a thorough overview of the literature,
highlighting research issues that highlight the application of blockchain technology in
healthcare systems. Beyond theoretical frameworks, the study explores particular
healthcare application areas, demonstrating how blockchain brings about novel solutions.
The benefits of blockchain technology are discussed in relation to healthcare systems,
ranging from guaranteeing data security to improving interoperability and controlling the
supply chain. The study also analyzes blockchain's application in consent systems and
patient records management, emphasizing its practical consequences. As the conversation
progresses, a detailed analysis of the constraints and difficulties encountered is provided,
providing insightful information on the complex realities of using blockchain in the
healthcare industry. The report also identifies areas that call for more investigation and
creativity, laying the foundation for future research directions. All things considered, this
study adds to the expanding corpus of research on blockchain technology in healthcare by

offering a thorough grasp of its uses, difficulties, and prospects.

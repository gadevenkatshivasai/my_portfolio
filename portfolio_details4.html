            <h2>BLOCKCHAIN FOR HEALTHCARE APPLICATIONS</h2>
            <p>
              <h3> Objective/Problem Statement</h3>
              <p> The healthcare industry faces numerous challenges related to electronic health record (EHR) systems, including data security, interoperability, and supply chain management. Blockchain technology has emerged as a potential solution to these issues. The objective of this study is to analyze the current state of blockchain applications in healthcare, identify its potential benefits and limitations, and explore its promise as well as the challenges associated with its implementation.</p>
              <h3> What We Did</h3>
              <P> We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 144 academic publications to assess the application of blockchain technology in the healthcare industry. This study provides a thorough examination of the foundational aspects of blockchain, its unique characteristics, and how these features can be leveraged to address specific challenges in healthcare. We explored various application areas within healthcare, including data security, interoperability, supply chain management, consent systems, and patient records management</P>
              <h3> Key Features</h3>
              <p>
                <li><strong> Data Security:</strong> Blockchainâ€™s ability to secure sensitive health data through cryptographic methods</li>
                <li> <strong> Interoperability:</strong> Enhancing the exchange of information between different healthcare systems using blockchain</li>
                <li> <strong> Supply Chain Management: </strong> Using blockchain to track and verify the authenticity of drugs and medical supplies</li>
                <li> <strong> Consent Systems:</strong> Managing patient consent and ensuring transparency in the use of health data</li>
                <li><strong> Patient Records Management:</strong> Securely storing and sharing patient records across different healthcare providers</li>
              </p>
              <h3> Functionality</h3>
              <li><strong> Blockchain Foundations</strong>The study begins with an overview of blockchain technology, focusing on its decentralized, immutable, and transparent nature.
              </li>

            <h2><strong> Handwritten Digit Classification</strong></h2>
            <p>
              <h3> Objective / Problem Statement</h3>
              <p> The goal of this project is to develop a robust neural network model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits. Using the MNIST dataset, a widely recognized benchmark in machine learning and computer vision, the project aims to build a system that can effectively recognize digits from 0 to 9 in real-world applications such as postal services, banking, and document digitization. The challenge is to achieve high accuracy while preventing overfitting and ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data.</p>
              <h3> What I Did</h3>
              <p> The project began with the preprocessing of the MNIST dataset, which includes 70,000 images (60,000 training images and 10,000 test images) of handwritten digits in a 28x28 pixel grayscale format. Key preprocessing steps involved normalizing the pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 and reshaping the images to fit the input requirements of the neural network.

                To understand the dataset better, I employed visualization techniques, analyzing the distribution of digits and identifying any potential anomalies. These visualizations helped ensure a thorough understanding of the data, which is crucial for model development.
                
                I then constructed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. The CNN architecture was carefully designed to capture spatial hierarchies in the images, balancing complexity and performance. The model included multiple layers:
                <li> <strong> Convolutional Layers:</strong> To extract features from the images.</li>
                <li><strong> Pooling Layers: </strong> To reduce the dimensionality and retain important features</li>
                <li><strong> Fully Connected Layers: </strong> To integrate the features for classification.</li>
                <li><strong> Activation Functions: </strong> Activation Functions: To introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns</li>
                Training was performed using the training dataset, with techniques such as data augmentation, dropout, and early stopping implemented to prevent overfitting. These methods helped enhance the model's generalization capabilities, making it more effective when dealing with new, unseen data.

After training, the model’s performance was rigorously evaluated on the test dataset. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to provide a comprehensive assessment of the model’s effectiveness.

The project concluded with an analysis of the model’s predictions, focusing particularly on misclassified digits. Visualizing these misclassifications helped identify areas for potential improvement, offering insights into the model's limitations and opportunities for further refinement.

                </p>
                <h3> Outcome</h3>
                <p> The final model achieved a high accuracy rate on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying handwritten digits. The CNN’s ability to generalize across different digit styles was confirmed, and the use of advanced techniques like data augmentation and dropout significantly contributed to its performance.

                  This project successfully built a system that can be applied in real-world scenarios, such as automated digit recognition systems in postal services, banking, and the digitization of handwritten documents.</p>
